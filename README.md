# LibtorchTrade
Reinforcement learning trader for BTC written in C++ using libtorch

## Guiding principles
* Fast
    * Written purely in C++.
    * Support multi-threading training.
    * Since the daily historical data is a small dataset(4MB), it can easily fit into the cache. So it is at least twice faster to train using CPU than GPUs.
    * A sample training log, it is just 20 seconds training.

## Build
* You need to install [libtorch C++](https://pytorch.org/cppdocs/) first, then run the commands below:
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=<path to libtorch> ..
make
```

## Training
* A simple heuristic feature selection algorithm is implemented. To train with this algorithm:
```
train feature_add
```
